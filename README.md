# Coconut Leaf Detection Application

## Overview
The Coconut Leaf Detection application is designed to identify and analyze coconut leaf images for various purposes, including detecting nutritional deficiencies and parasitic infections. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to automate the detection process, providing a user-friendly interface for users to upload images and receive analysis results.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories and files:

- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines and runs multi-container Docker applications.
- **docs/**: Contains various documentation files, including proposals, design diagrams, reports, and references.
- **data/**: Holds all coconut leaf image data, organized into:
  - `raw/`: Raw drone images.
  - `annotated/`: Labeled images for nutritional and parasitic analysis.
  - `processed/`: Resized and normalized images.
  - `splits/`: Train, validation, and test splits.
- **ml/**: Contains the machine learning module, including:
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and augmentation.
  - `src/`: Source code for data loading, model architecture, training, evaluation, inference, metrics, and utility functions.
  - `weights/`: Saved model files.
  - `ai_api/`: Flask/FastAPI microservice for predictions.
- **backend/**: Contains the backend code, including:
  - Main server file, configuration files, models, controllers, routes, services, middleware, utilities, uploads, and tests.
- **frontend/**: Contains the frontend code, including:
  - Configuration files for Tailwind CSS and Vite, main application files, components, pages, services, context, hooks, styles, and utilities.
- **deployment/**: Contains files related to deployment, including Nginx configuration, deployment scripts, and environment variable examples.

## Installation
